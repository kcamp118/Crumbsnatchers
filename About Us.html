                  <p>Head of the bakery. I have an innate sweet tooth, but I also have a passion for non-toxic clean ingredients. So, I wanted to combine not only my love for sweets but sweet treats. But I also wanted to extend these treats to not only my family, but my extended family to you all. The last 11 years have allowed me to expand my success and grow.</p>
